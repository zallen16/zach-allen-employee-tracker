# zach-allen-employee-tracker

This week's assignment comprised of starting from scratch on an application caapble of tracking employees in an intricate database. Using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. A Schema, Seeds, and Query file were all created for the purpose of pre-populating the databse. The application successfully shows the user a main menu in which they can choose to view departments, roles, and employees, as well as add roles & employees, and finally update an employee role. The app is designed to show tables with said information after selecting them, which can also be manipulated by selecting the latter options of adding or updating information.
